### What is brightness?

Luminance, or brightness, refers to the **light intensity of a monitor’s screen**. It’s a measurement of the light that a display emits, measured in nits, that is equal to one candela per square meter.&#x20;

Brighter displays ensure a screen's contents are easy to read, even in sunny conditions. You can adjust the brightness of a screen to ensure that when you’re viewing a photo on one monitor, it appears in the same light and intensity as it does on another monitor.
