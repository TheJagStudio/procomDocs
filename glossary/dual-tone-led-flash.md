### What is a dual-tone LED flash?

Dual-tone LED flashes were created as a solution to the unnatural and cold tones often resulting from mobile flash photography. **This technology works with two LED lights set at different color temperatures, producing a tone that is more true to life.**\

Dual-tone flash technology not only helps provide more desirable color balance for photos and videos but also enhances the artificial illumination's reach. This happens thanks to more powerful light emission, meaning that objects which are further away can also be in the frame with this feature. The ratio between the different color temperatures is adjusted by the device’s software, which employs white balance information in this calculation.\

Apple first introduced dual-tone flash technology in September 2013, with its iPhone 5S. Comprising white and amber-colored LED flashes, the feature was named "True Tone." At the time, the brand stated that its iSight camera applied software algorithms to assess the scene’s actual color temperature, adjusting its white and amber light proportion accordingly. The brand has maintained True Tone technology in its following releases. Nowadays, dual-tone LED flash is a common feature for mobile devices, and certainly a user-favorite.\

When it comes to tablets, dual-tone LED flash technology is not as widespread as it is within the smartphone business. Still, consumers' demand for improved tablet photography is rising, and there are numerous options for tablets with dual-tone LED flash. If you're an Apple fan, there's no need to worry: True Tone is now a standard feature for iPads.
