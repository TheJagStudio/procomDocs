### What is fast charging?

As we move further into an increasingly fast-paced world, consumers are interested in being able to charge their devices rapidly. It’s why **fast charging cables** and even fast wireless charging stations have become so popular. But what is fast charging, and how do you identify a fast charging cable?

Let’s start with the basics of charging. Most devices charge at **5 volts and 2.4 amperes**, or 5V/2.4A. Fast charging cables can increase that voltage by intervals of 5V, 9V, or 12V while also increasing the amperage up to 3A.

This is where the fast charging cable comes into place. How do you identify a fast charging cable? Your standard **USB 1.0 and 2.0** will charge at **5V and 0.5A** for a total wattage of 2.5W.  If you’re using a **USB 3.0 port**, that charge can get pushed to **5V/0.9A** for a total of 4.5W.

USB 3.1 ports are relatively new and will allow you to charge at a maximum power output of 20V/5A for a total of 100W. While this sounds great, it’s essential to check the Battery Charging Specifications of the device you’re charging to ensure that it can handle such power.&#x20;

Currently, various smartphones allow for fast charging. The OnePlus Nord, for example, has a battery power of 4115mAh and can charge from 0 to 70% in as fast as 30 minutes. The Realme X50 5G, however, kicks things up a notch with its 4200mAh battery power, allowing for a charge from 0 to 60% in just 20 minutes.
