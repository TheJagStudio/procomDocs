### What is a fingerprint scanner?

**Our fingerprints function as biometric identity cards with which we are born (as no two prints are alike).** For this reason, not only are fingerprints crucial when it comes to solving crimes, but they have also made fingerprint scanning a widespread security system. Over the past years, fingerprint recognition technology has become a standard smartphone feature, included in every flagship phone, in almost all mid-range models, as well as in budget smartphones.\
\
**When it comes to consumer electronics, fingerprint scanners are generally used to unlock devices, provide secure folder access, and authorize transactions.** Fingerprint recognition systems are either stagnant or moving: the first type requires the user to drag their finger over the scanning area, whereas the second (and most reliable) form has a scanner that moves across the area. As for scanning technology, the most popular methods are optical scanning, capacitative scanning (or CMOS scanning), ultrasonic scanning, and thermal scanning.\
\
The oldest method of fingerprint recognition, optical scanning works with a digital camera that photographs the fingerprint, and with algorithms that detect distinctive features (like ridges and patterns). This method is flawed by low scan resolution and 2D-imaging, which makes it relatively easy to dupe. Currently, the most popular fingerprint scanners are capacitive systems, which utilize electrical current to trace the details of a fingerprint (although a finger mold may still fool it). Another advanced fingerprint recognition tech is ultrasonic scanning. Still quite expensive, ultrasonic fingerprint readers employ high-frequency waves that penetrate the skin and read fingerprint information underneath the epidermis. Finally, thermal scanners operate by detecting temperature variation between a fingerprint's unique ridges and valleys and generating a high-quality grayscale image.\

A growing number of smartphone manufacturers are utilizing in-display fingerprint scanners, allowing for gorgeous edge-to-edge displays. The first smartphone to incorporate an in-display fingerprint scanner was the Vivo X20 Plus UD, released in 2018. Since then, in-display fingerprint scanners have become more common and can even be found on mid-range phones such as the Samsung Galaxy A31. It’s worth noting, however, that the majority of phones with in-display readers use optical scanning technology. The superior ultrasonic fingerprint scanners are currently only found on high-end Samsung phones, such as the Samsung Galaxy S21 5G. With security being a mounting concern, fingerprint scanners are also in high demand for other devices such as tablets and laptops.
