### What are tflops, or teraflops?

**Teraflops, or tflops, are a measure of graphical power and they’re relevant to gaming consoles and GPUs. The term flops stands for floating-point operations per second.**

These floating-point operations are complex calculations that the gaming console or GPU are carrying out each second. So, the more flops that a console has, the more powerful it is in terms of image rendering and similar actions.

In 2020, the Xbox Series X made headlines when it was announced that it would have 12 teraflops of GPU power, meaning that it can carry out 12 trillion floating-point operations per second. To provide a bit of a base, the Sony PlayStation 5 is only slated to come with 10.28 teraflops.

It’s important to note that other GPU specifications such as memory speed, along with device-specific specs all influence the overall performance of the device. A higher number of tflops in a gaming console, therefore, doesn’t mean that it’s inherently better.
