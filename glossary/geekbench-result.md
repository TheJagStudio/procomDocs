### What is Geekbench?

**Geekbench measures processor performance across macOS, Windows, Linux, Android, and iOS platforms.** This benchmark simulates real-life usage scenarios, resulting in scores that distinguish between single-core and multi-core performance.

&#x20;

Geekbench is managed by Canadian software performance company Primate Labs. Its current version, Geekbench 5, also assesses GPU performance for processors with integrated graphics. The baseline score of 1000 represents the performance results of the Intel Core i3-8100 CPU. Higher ratings indicate better performance.

&#x20;

Users employ the Geekbench tool to measure their CPUs and upload the results to an open platform, Geekbench Browser. Versus displays the performance score for every CPU with a public Geekbench result.
