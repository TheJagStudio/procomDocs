### What is GPU clock speed?

**Also known as engine clock, GPU clock speed indicates how fast the cores of a graphics processing unit (GPU) are.** The function of these cores is to render graphics; therefore, the higher the GPU clock speed, the faster the processing.\
\
The engine clock is **measured in megahertz (MHz)**, with one MHz being equal to one million hertz. As is the case with total clock speed for a CPU’s computing tasks, the GPU clock speed translates into how many processing cycles per second can be executed by the graphics processing unit.\
\
Although the engine clock is not the only element to impact a GPU's performance, a fast GPU is particularly valued by gamers, image editors, and other people who deal with image processing tasks. To obtain increased performance, some users opt for overclocking, a process that consists of running the GPU (or a CPU) faster than the speed established by the manufacturer.\
\
GPU clock speed is one of the most relevant specs to watch for when choosing a graphics card for your computer, especially if you're into gaming or other graphics-intensive activities.
