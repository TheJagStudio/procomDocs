### What are IP ratings?

IP ratings, or ingress protection ratings, are **a way of classifying the level of protection provided by a device's enclosure against the intrusion of solid objects and liquids.** The rating is given as a two-digit code, with the first digit representing the level of protection against solid objects (such as sand and dust) and the second digit representing the level of protection against liquids.&#x20;

### &#x20;IPX2 rating

IPX2 is a type of ingress protection rating which indicates that the device has **a low level of protection against liquids, and no dustproof rating.**

Specifically, a device with an IPX2 rating is protected against vertically falling drops of water, but not against water sprayed at it from any angle.

This means that while a device with an IPX2 rating may be able to withstand light rain or condensation, it is not suitable for use in wet or damp environments.

### &#x20;

### IPX3 rating

An IPX3 rating indicates that the device has a **low to moderate level of protection against liquids.**

Specifically, a device with an IPX3 rating is protected against water sprayed at it from a 60-degree angle, but not against water sprayed at it from a wider angle or against water sprayed at it with high pressure.

This means that while a device with an IPX3 rating may be able to withstand light rain or splashing water, but is not suitable for use in wet or damp environments where the device may be exposed to more significant amounts of water.

### &#x20;

### IPX4 rating

The "4" in "IPX4" indicates the product's level of protection against water splashes.

**IPX4-rated products are protected against water splashes from any direction, but not against submersion.** This means that the product will be safe from water splashes, but it should not be submerged in water or exposed to water jets.

### &#x20;

### IPX5 rating

The IPX5 rating means that a device has been tested and is protected against water projected from a nozzle at a high-pressure and flow rate. This means that **the device can withstand being splashed with water from all angles, but it cannot be fully immersed in water or subjected to high-pressure water jets.**

For example, a device with an IPX5 rating can be used outdoors in light rain or splashed with water, but it should not be submerged in water or used in heavy rain or in wet environments.

### &#x20;

### IPX6 rating

The IPX6 rating indicates that the device is protected against strong jets of water from any direction. This means that **it can withstand powerful water sprays and heavy rainfall, but it is not designed for submersion in water.**

The IPX6 rating is commonly used for outdoor electronics such as portable speakers and camping lanterns. It provides a good level of protection against water damage, but it is not as robust as higher ratings.

### &#x20;

### IPX7 rating

IPX7 is a rating that indicates that the device is p**rotected against water ingress when immersed in up to 1 meter of water for up to 30 minutes**. This means that it can be submerged in water without any harm to its internal components. This is a relatively high level of water resistance and is suitable for use in wet conditions or water sports.

### &#x20;

### IPX8 rating

The IPX8 rating indicates that **the device can be submerged in water for extended periods of time, typically for 30 minutes or more, at a depth of 1 meter or more.** This makes it suitable for use in very wet environments, such as in heavy rain or while swimming.

It's important to note that the IPX8 rating is not a guarantee of water-tightness. The rating only applies to the specific conditions under which the device was tested, and it may not be as resistant to water in other situations. Additionally, the rating is only valid for fresh water, and may not apply to other liquids, such as salt water or chlorinated water.

In general, devices with an IPX8 rating are considered to be highly water-resistant and suitable for use in wet environments. However, it's always a good idea to check the manufacturer's specifications and use the device carefully to avoid damaging it.

### IP44 rating

The IP44 rating is a standard that measures the ingress protection of a device. The first digit, "4," indicates that the device has protection against solid objects like dust. The second digit, "4," indicates that the device has protection against water splashes from any direction.

**This means that the device is protected against some dust and water but not against prolonged water exposure or high-pressure water jets.**

### &#x20;

### IP45 rating

The IP45 rating indicates that a device has been tested and is **protected against the ingress of solid foreign objects larger than 1mm, such as tools and wires, and is also protected against water spray from all directions.**

This rating is commonly used for outdoor electrical equipment and devices that are not intended to be submerged in water.

### &#x20;

### IP52 rating

The IP52 rating indicates that a device is protected against solid objects larger than 12.5 millimeters (such as hands and fingers), and is protected against vertically dripping water when the enclosure is tilted at an angle of up to 15 degrees from its normal operating position.

This means that t**he device should be able to withstand light splashes and spills, but it should not be submerged in water or exposed to heavy water spray.**

### &#x20;

### IP53 rating

The IP53 rating is made up of two parts: the first digit (5) refers to the level of protection against solid objects, while the second digit (3) refers to the level of protection against liquids. In this case, the "5" means that the device is protected against the ingress of dust and other solid objects, while the "3" means that it is protected against water spray.

In general, **a device with an IP53 rating will be able to withstand light exposure to water and dust, but it should not be fully submerged or exposed to heavy rain.** It is important to check the specific specifications of a device to see how it has been tested and rated.
