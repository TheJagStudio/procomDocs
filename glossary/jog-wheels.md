### What are jog wheels?

Jog wheels are knobs typically incorporated into professional DJ, audio mixing, and video editing equipment. **Also known as shuttle wheels, shuttle dials, and jog dials, this type of knob helps professionals conveniently jog or shuttle through media.**

&#x20;

In this context, "jogging" stands for going over content at low speeds, whereas "shuttling" represents the opposite. Jog wheels facilitate different effects and come in handy for audio and video editing, as well as for recordings and live performances.

&#x20;

The original concept behind jog wheels was to allow for DJs working with digital content to operate much like they would with turntables. DJs can pause, scratch, and cue music backward and forward with most jog wheels, adjusting audio speed.
