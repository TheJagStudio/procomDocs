### What are megapixels?

**The smallest controllable portion of a digital image, a pixel is a square or non-square image element, like a piece in a mosaic. A megapixel (MP) comprises 1,000,000 pixels, and the number of megapixels offered by a camera system represents the amount of information that it can deliver into a digital photograph or video.**\
\
More megapixels translate into a more accurate representation of the elements framed in a photograph. Yet, although the prevailing notion may be that the more megapixels you can get, the better, it's essential to keep in mind that more megapixels represent a bulkier file, which will take more resources for storage, transfer, as well as for image processing. Often, a user may opt to generate photos with a resolution lower than the maximum number of megapixels that their digital camera can offer (be it a smartphone or a separate camera system), since that may save space and facilitate editing.\
\
When considering the number of megapixels, you must factor in your resources and your objectives: is it just an image for Instagram? Or will it be used professionally, perhaps even displayed on a billboard? Each purpose will translate into different requirements, and other determinants, such as pixel density, need to be taken into account.

#### Which smartphones have the highest number of megapixels?

The age of smartphone photography was inaugurated almost twenty years ago. Back then, selfies weren't a "thing," and a VGA camera with 0.3 megapixels was all one could dream of. Since then, the initially sad amount of megapixels has grown into an average of 29MP for smartphones.\
\
It has become hard to keep up with the pace of smartphone photography: our phones are now equipped with fancy sensors, professional photography features, and even several lenses for each camera system (primary and front). And what's more, you can already choose a phone with a total amount of 242 megapixels (between its four rear cameras) – the Honor Magic 3 Pro Plus.
