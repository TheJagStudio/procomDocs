### What is the definition of memory bandwidth?

**Bandwidth** refers to the amount of data transmitted from one place to another in a given amount of time. Consumers typically see bandwidth expressed as it relates to internet service. While often confused with “internet speed,” bandwidth is the volume of information, expressed in Mbps, that can be sent over the internet connection per second.

### What is max memory bandwidth?

Unlike internet bandwidth, **maximum memory bandwidt**h is expressed in gigabytes per second. It refers to the amount of data that can be read from or stored into memory on a CPU or GPU at any given time.

Calculating the max memory bandwidth requires that you take the type of storage into account along with the number of data transfers per clock (DDR, DDR2, etc.), the memory bus width, and the number of interfaces.

For CPUs, the majority have a max memory bandwidth between 30.85GB/s  and 59.05GB/s. Higher-end CPUs such as the Intel Xeon Gold 6262V have a max memory bandwidth of 107.3GB/s while AMD manufactures two CPUs that reach up to 341 GB/s.
