### What is slow motion?

The cinematic style of slow-motion video recording was invented, oddly enough, by Austrian priest and physicist August Musger in the early 20th century. **Informally known as "slo-mo" these days, the technique results in slow-moving video images and a sensation that time is passing by at a slower pace.**\
\
Although one might think that slow motion in digital video making is achieved by recording a video at a slower speed, the style results from the opposite: capturing images faster than the playback rate. There are, however, other techniques to achieve slow-motion aesthetics, such as playing regular footage at a slower speed (e.g., instant replay for a sports match) and post-processing via software. Popular frame rates for standard videos are 24fps and 30fps; when it comes to slow-motion videos, those range between 60fps and 960fps (known as super slow motion).\
\
What has made slow-motion video recording so popular among consumers is its impactful aesthetic effect. In addition to this, slo-mo video can also come in handy: for instance, when it comes to observing natural phenomena (as an example, a flower blossoming) or studying athletic techniques.\
\
When recording slow-motion videos, keep in mind that files may be larger than standard video files, so be attentive to your device's storage space; the reason for this is that more frames are captured in slo-mo.\
\
Slow motion has become a standard video recording feature for high-end and mid-range phones and is also available in some budget models. As always, you can count on Versus to double-check if a smartphone includes the sought-after feature.
