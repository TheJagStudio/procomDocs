### What is texture rate?

To understand the **texture rate of a GPU**, it helps first to know how it relates to the graphics card of a device and how they’re both tied to the GPU clock speed. Also known as engine clock, **GPU clock speed** indicates how fast the cores of a graphics processing unit (GPU) are. The function of these cores is to render graphics; therefore, the higher the GPU clock speed, the faster the processing.

Now, texture rate, also called texture fill rate, refers to the number of textured pixels that a graphics card can render on the screen every second. This means that it refers to the speed at which a graphics card can essentially “fill” the screen with pixels.

To calculate the texture fill rate, you need to know the GPU clock speed and the amount of TMUs, or texture mapping units, that a graphics card has. Generally, you’ll follow the following formula. You always express the texture fill rate as a measurement over time. The measurement is texels, which represent textured picture elements that are processed and shown on the screen.

**Core Clock Speed x TMUs = Texture Fill Rate**

However, depending on the hardware itself, the actual numbers can vary. In the case of the PNY Quadro RTX 8000, the core clock speed is 1395MHz, and the card has 288 TMUs. But you’ll see that the texture rate is 509.8 GTexels/s.
