### What is an ultra power-saving mode?

**Choosing an ultra power-saving mode is an effective way to keep a device running at low battery levels.** Manufacturers market this feature under different names, but the principle is the same: limited functionality in exchange for extra hours of battery life.

&#x20;

These modes generally **limit screen brightness, resolution, and contrast.** Other common strategies are **disabling sensors such as GPS** and **restricting connectivity, CPU speed, and available apps.** Given the limited functionalities, consumers may only want to choose this option when there is a great need to preserve battery life.

&#x20;

Samsung was one of the first companies to introduce the ultra power-saving mode on its Galaxy S5, announced at the 2014 Mobile World Congress. Sony announced its _STAMINA Mode_ around the same time, and HTC followed shortly with the _Extreme Power-Saving Mode_.

&#x20;

One year later, Android 5.0 Lollipop was released with a battery-saving mode that became an Android standard. Yet, many manufacturers deliver new tactics. Apple's power-saving feature, _Low Power Mode,_ is automatically activated when the battery reaches 20%. According to the company, it provides an extra three hours of battery life.
